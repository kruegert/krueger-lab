  description: Our work in the biomedical field enables human-in-the-loop data analysis of increasingly large and complex molecular data (imaging and spatial omics) acquired for biomedical research, notable to for cancer analysis, diagnosis, and therapy. We work closely with biomedical users to survey their goals and requirements, iteratively develop visualization prototypes, and conduct hands-on studies for qualitative and quantitative evaluation.

  description: Our geographical visulization research focuses on large and time-varying urban data to better understand urban environments and human factors. We develop and evaluate large-scale visualization and analytics approaches that combine classical geographical data (e.g. maps, satellite imagery) with spatially referenced data, e.g. from social media.
