We live in a digital biology era. New biomedical imaging and sequencing methods produce increasingly large amounts of data. Artificial intelligence enables the processing and analysis of this data in unprecedented ways. However, expert involvement and human domain knowledge are still essential, especially in exploratory biology research with rapidly changing data acquisition and experimental methods. This also applies to medical decision‐making where human life and well‐being are at stake. Our research in biomedical data visualization combines modern data analytics with highly interactive visual interfaces to support workflows and practices in biomedical research and clinical application. We develop novel scalable visualization methods and suitable visual encodings that enable users to display, navigate, and explore large and multivariate imaging and omics data. To understand the spatial organization and functional building blocks of biological microenvironments, we design and evaluate ways to integrate machine learning into visual analytics interfaces. To inform and communicate science and new insights to biomedical research communities, we work on novel ways of visual data communication and storytelling. We work closely with biomedical users. This ranges from survey and requirement analysis to iterative prototype development and hands‐on studies for qualitative and quantitative evaluation. Our research and development results in widely used open‐source software.
