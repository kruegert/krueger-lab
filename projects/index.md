The krueger lab will have its focus areas on scalable visualization and visual analytics of spatial data (as it appears in biomedical and geographical application fields), on developing novel information visualizations, and on bringing visualization and analysis methods and workflows to novel AR & VR environments. We aim to work on these topicsby aquiring research funds from NSF, NIH, and other sources.
